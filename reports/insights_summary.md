Amazon E-commerce Sales & Customer Analytics
Executive Insights Summary
1. Business Objective

The objective of this project was to analyze Amazon e-commerce sales data to uncover actionable insights related to revenue performance, profitability, customer behavior, and segmentation. The goal was to support data-driven decision-making in sales optimization and customer retention strategies.

2. Revenue Performance Analysis
Key Metrics:

Total Sales: 179K

Total Profit: 72K

Profit Margin: 40%

Total Customers: 10

Average Order Value (AOV): 1.03K

Insights:

Revenue peaked in February (91K) and slightly declined in March (85K).

April shows a sharp drop (3K), likely reflecting partial month data rather than true performance decline.

The business maintains a strong 40% profit margin, indicating healthy pricing and cost structure.

AOV of 1.03K suggests customers are making relatively high-value purchases.

Business Implication:

Revenue is stable with strong margins, but further monitoring of April trends is necessary to confirm whether the decline is seasonal or data-related.

3. Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

Customers were segmented using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scoring into five groups:

Champions

Loyal Customers

At Risk

Potential

Lost Customers

Key Findings:

Champions have the highest Customer Lifetime Value (26K).

Loyal Customers follow closely with 22K CLV.

At Risk customers contribute the largest share of revenue (~30%), despite not being top CLV holders.

Lost and Potential segments show moderate CLV but require engagement strategies.

Business Implication:

Champions should be rewarded with loyalty incentives.

At Risk customers represent a major revenue opportunity — retention campaigns could significantly impact revenue stability.

Lost customers require reactivation strategies.

4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

CLV modeling shows clear differentiation among segments:

Segment	Average CLV
Champions	26K
Loyal Customers	22K
At Risk	18K
Lost Customers	16K
Potential	13K
Insight:

High CLV concentration among Champions and Loyal customers suggests that revenue sustainability depends heavily on retaining high-value segments.

5. Revenue Concentration

Top customers contribute a significant portion of overall revenue.

Olivia Wilson and Emma Clark generate the highest sales (30K and 26K respectively).

Revenue concentration risk exists if top customers reduce spending.

Business Implication:

Customer diversification strategies should be considered to reduce dependency on a small customer base.

6. Strategic Recommendations
1️ Retention Strategy

Focus on the “At Risk” segment since it contributes the highest revenue share.

2️ Loyalty Incentives

Provide exclusive benefits to Champions and Loyal customers to maintain high CLV.

3️ Revenue Monitoring

Track monthly performance to confirm if April decline is temporary or structural.

4️ Customer Diversification

Reduce reliance on top 2–3 customers by expanding customer acquisition efforts.

5️ CLV-Based Marketing

Allocate marketing budget proportionally to high CLV segments.

7. Project Value

This project demonstrates:

End-to-end data pipeline (Python → SQL → Power BI)

Advanced customer segmentation using RFM scoring

Customer Lifetime Value modeling

Executive-level dashboard design

Actionable business recommendations

The analysis provides a structured foundation for improving revenue stability, customer retention, and long-term profitability.

Conclusion

The business is currently profitable and maintains strong margins. However, revenue concentration and reliance on at-risk segments represent strategic areas for improvement. Implementing retention-focused strategies and CLV-driven decision-making can enhance long-term growth and sustainability.
